# Flip-The-coin

in this project you can fing the game of 'flip the coin' and was made by 
javascript functions (implimenting the if conditions) and the settimout function also.

besides you can find me using the 'hover' option to make the button hover when it gets the cursor on it.
In addition i ised the math.random in order to have different results each time we flip the coin.

For the CSS i used to make the style on the html web page using '@KeyFrame' keyword to make an animation on the 
coin once we flip it with mentioning the degrees of the rotation.


Thank you
